## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## My process
I used divs for grouping element, giving them class names helped me style them with css properties.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- CSS Grid
-CSS media queries


### What I learned

Developing this project has helped me improve on my css skills. Using css grid, multiple media queries for respective screen views are improvement to my skills.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
  @media screen and (max-width: 1024px){

  }
  .div{
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 800px;
  }
}

### Continued development

my CSS grid and other properties (media queries) will need more practice.
